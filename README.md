# Multiple-Types-of-Bank-Accounts
A C++ project that includes different types of bank account classes to be accessed and used.

This project initially prompts the user to select a type of bank account to use from a menu.
Inheritance is used throughout this project, where the main base classes include a basic
bank account class and a checking account class. The types of bank accounts offered to the
user to select from on the menu include: 
1) A checking account with a service charge,
2) A checking account without a service charge,
3) A checking account with high interest,
4) A savings account,
5) A savings account with high interest,

There is basic functionality such as depositing, withdrawing, and it includes interest rates. There 
are exceptions included to ensure realistic functionality. There are also other features
in particular classes such as a minimum balance.
