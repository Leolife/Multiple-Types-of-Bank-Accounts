# Multiple-Types-of-Bank-Accounts
A c++ project that includes different types of bank account classes to be accessed and used.

This is a project that I, Leo Roth, have built and update from time to time as I learn new concepts.
This project initially prompts the user to select a type of bank account to use from a menu.
Inheritance is used throughout this project, where the main base classes include a basic
bank account class and a checking account class. The types of bank accounts offered to the
user to select from on the menu include: 
1) A checking account with a service charge,
2) A checking account without a service charge,
3) A checking account with high interest,
4) A savings account,
5) A savings account with high interest,
6) A certificate of deposit account.
There is basic functionality such as depositing, withdrawing, interest rates, and there 
are exceptions included to ensure realistic functiuonality. There are also other features
in particular classes such as a minimum balance.
